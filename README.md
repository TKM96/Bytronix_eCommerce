# BYTRONIX eCommerce
---------------------
## Project overview 
--------------------
BYTRONIX is a USA-based eCommerce retailer specializing in consumer electronics and related accessories, operating across nine major cities in the United States. Founded in 2023, the company has experienced rapid growth while navigating an increasingly competitive market, presenting both challenges and opportunities for operational and commercial optimization.

The company sells **19 products** across **9 cities** in USA, generated a revenue of **$34m** in 2025, currently serves approximately **141K customers** and processes an average of **489 orders** per day, with more than **178,000 orders** recorded and **208K units** sold in 2025. The dataset underpinning this analysis encompasses key dimensions and performance metrics, including sales revenue, product performance, regional sales distribution, and time-based trends. 

Reporting to the Regional Sales Manager, Head of Merchandising, Marketing Director , and the Finance and Strategy team, a comprehensive performance analysis was conducted to assess BYTRONIX’s business outcomes for the year of 2025 to improve rveneue growth and operational effeciency in 2026. While the overall sales appear strong, this analysis will provide clarity on what drives performance across products, locations, time periods and seasonality. This analysis provides actionable insights to support cross-functional stakeholders in streamlining operations, strengthening strategic decision-making, driving sustained improvements,  marketing spend, inventory planning, and pricing strategies for 2026.

## Time-based sales trends
---------------------------
https://github.com/TKM96/Bytronix_eCommerce/blob/main/REVENUE%20BY%20MONTH.png?raw=true
### Insights and key trends

* Average monthly sales for 2025 are **$2.87M**, serving as a clear benchmark across the year.
* Sales show strong seasonality, with underperformance in early and mid-year, followed by a pronounced surge in **Q4**.
* **Q1** (Jan–Mar): Soft start. January records the lowest sales at **$1.8M**, with gradual improvement through March, but still largely below the annual average. This suggests   post-holiday demand fatigue and cautious consumer spending early in the year.
* **Q2** (Apr–Jun): Short-lived momentum. April and May exceed the annual average, indicating successful promotions or product demand. However, momentum drops again in June, signaling inconsistency in sustaining growth.
* **Q3** (Jul–Sep): Mid-year slowdown. Sales remain consistently below average, pointing to a seasonal lull common in electronics retail, possibly due to fewer product launches and lower discretionary spend.
* **Q4** (Oct–Dec): Peak performance. October marks a strong rebound, with December peaking at $4.6M, the highest month of the year. This confirms heavy reliance on holiday sales, promotions, and year-end consumer demand.

### Recommendations

* **Strengthen Non-Q4 Demand**
* **Introduce Q1 and Q3 targeted campaigns** (e.g., back-to-school tech, mid-year upgrades, bundle deals).
* **Leverage financing options** (BNPL, extended warranties) to stimulate discretionary purchases.
* **Replicate Q4 Success Drivers**
* **Analyze Q4 drivers** (product mix, pricing, channels, promotions) and test scaled-down versions earlier in the year.
* **Pull forward select holiday-style bundles** into **May and August**.
* **Inventory & Supply Chain Optimization**
* **Align inventory more closely with Q4 demand spikes** to avoid stockouts.
* **Reduce carrying costs during slower months** by using demand forecasting and just-in-time restocking. 
* **Use Q4 customer acquisition** to fuel loyalty programs and remarketing in **Q1**.
* **Segment customers** by purchase behavior to personalize offers during off-peak periods.

### Insights

* The year delivered significant month-on-month growth, with the sharpest spike in **Q4**, October **(+78%)** and strong uplift again in December **(+44%)**.
* However, there were notable dips in June **(-18%)** and August **(-15%)**, 
   suggesting off-season weakness or campaign gaps.
* **Q1 to Q2** show a steady decline in sales.
* **Q2 to Q3** were stagnant with July showing a slight increase but sales remained at all 
   time lows.

https://github.com/TKM96/Bytronix_eCommerce/blob/main/ORDERS%20BY%20HOUR.png?raw=true          
### Insights and key trends

* Clear peak demand windows: Orders ramp up     from early morning, peaking   around midday **(~12:00, ~12K orders)** and again in the early evening **(~19:00, ~12.4K orders)**.
* Lowest activity overnight: Very low order volume between **02:00–05:00**, indicating minimal customer engagement during these hours.
* Sustained afternoon performance: Post-midday volumes remain relatively strong through **14:00–17:00**, suggesting consistent demand beyond lunch hours.
* Evening outperforms midday: The highest spike occurs in the evening, signaling strong after-work or leisure purchasing behavior.

### Recommendations

* **Align staffing & operations**: Increase fulfillment, customer support, and delivery capacity during **11:00–14:00 and 18:00–20:00** to avoid bottlenecks.
* **Optimize marketing timing**: Schedule promotions, push notifications, and email campaigns just before peak hours to maximize conversion.
* **Drive off-peak demand**: Introduce targeted discounts or bundles during early morning and late-night hours to smooth demand and improve utilization.
* **System performance readiness**: Ensure platform stability and checkout performance are optimized for evening peak traffic, when demand is highest.

### Insights

* Revenue is highly concentrated in premium electronics, with **MacBook Pro Laptop ($8M)** significantly outperforming all other products, indicating a strong reliance on high-ticket items for total revenue.
* **Smartphones and laptops dominate the top tier**, with iPhone, Thinkpad Laptop, and the google phone forming a strong secondary revenue cluster. 
* **Accessories and consumables (cables, headphones, batteries) generate low individual revenue**, suggesting they'revolume-driven but not primary revenue drivers . 
* **Large appliances and monitors contribute moderate revenue**, indicating steady but less scalable demand compared to personal electronics.

### Recommendations

* **Double down on high-perfoming premium products** by prioritizing inventory availability, targeted promotions, and upsell/bundling strategies.
* **Use low-revenue accessories as attach-rate drivers**, bundling them with high-value products to increase overall order value.
* **Review underperforming SKUs** to determine whether to optimise pricing, reposition marketing, or rationalise the product range.
* **Invest in cross-sell strategies** (e.g laptops+monitors+accessories) to leverage existing demand and grow revenue per customer.
* **Reduce revenue concentration risk** by identifying  adjecent high-margin products that can diversify top-line performance.

## Basket Analysis
-------------------
https://github.com/TKM96/Bytronix_eCommerce/blob/main/BASKET%20ANALYSIS%20TABLE.png?raw=true

### Insights

* Strong accessory attach rates: Smartphones are most frequently purchased with charging cables **(Lightning–iPhone: 1,011; Google Phone–USB-C: 997)**, confirming cables as high-velocity add-ons.
* Audio as a common companion: Wired and wireless headphones frequently bundle with phones **(e.g., iPhone–Wired Headphones: 462; Google Phone–Wired Headphones: 422)**, indicating strong cross-sell potential.
* Ecosystem-driven buying: Apple products show consistent bundling (iPhone with Lightning cables and AirPods), reflecting brand ecosystem loyalty.
* Low-cost impulse add-ons: Batteries (AA/AAA) regularly appear with cables and headphones, suggesting last-minute basket expansion at checkout.

### Recommendations

* **Bundle strategically**: Create phone + cable + headphone bundles (with small discounts) to increase AOV and reduce purchase friction.
* **Optimise checkout cross-sells**: Surface cables and headphones prominently when a phone is added to cart; promote batteries as impulse add-ons.
* **Inventory prioritisation**: Ensure high availability of top-paired accessories to avoid lost cross-sell revenue.
* **Targeted promotions**: Use ecosystem-based offers (e.g., Apple or Android bundles) to capitalize on brand-aligned purchasing behaviour.

## Geographic performance
--------------------------
https://github.com/TKM96/Bytronix_eCommerce/blob/main/REVENUE%20BY%20CITY.png?raw=true

### Insights

* **San Francisco** is the clear revenue leader at approximately **$8.2M**, significantly outperforming all other cities and acting as the primary revenue driver.
* **Los Angeles and New York City form a strong second tier**, contributing solid but noticeably lower revenue than San Francisco.
* **Mid-tier cities (Boston, Atlanta, Dallas, Seattle, Portland)** show relatively similar performance, indicating stable but non-differentiated demand.
* **Austin is the lowest-performing market** at around **$1.8M**, suggesting limited scale or market penetration.

### Recommendations

* **Double down on San Francisco** by protecting market share through retention initiatives, premium offerings, and targeted upsell strategies.
* **Accelerate growth in Los Angeles and New York City** with focused marketing spend and localized promotions to close the gap with San Francisco.
* **Optimize mid-tier cities** by testing scalable campaigns and operational efficiencies to lift performance without heavy investment.
* **Reassess the Austin strategy**: either invest selectively to stimulate growth or rationalize spend if ROI remains low.

## Average Order Value(AOV) per city
-------------------------------------
https://github.com/TKM96/Bytronix_eCommerce/blob/main/AOV%20PER%20CITY.png?raw=true

### Insights

* Seattle, Dallas, and Portland form a **solid mid-tier**, with AOVs clustered around **193–194**, suggesting consistent but slightly lower basket sizes.
* San Francisco and Boston show **moderate AOVs (~192)**, potentially impacted by higher competition or more price-sensitive purchasing behavior.
* **Austin and Los Angeles have the **lowest AOVs (~191)**, signaling smaller basket sizes despite being large, high-traffic markets.

### Recommendations

* **Prioritize premium product bundles and upsell strategies** in Atlanta and NYC to maximize revenue from already high-value customers.
* **Test targeted cross-sell offers in mid-tier cities** (Seattle, Dallas, Portland) to push AOV above the 195 threshold.
* **Introduce incentives like free shipping thresholds or bundle discounts** in Austin and Los Angeles to encourage larger basket sizes.
* **Segment city-level marketing strategies**, using AOV as a key metric to tailor promotions rather than applying a one-size-fits-all approach.
